This project is intended to use responsive design, HTML, CSS, and a bit of javascript
to highlight my growing skills and showcase some of my previous projects from Udacity.

The page is a simple layout that has a logo, title, banner image, and 3 featured projects.

Each project has a hidden modal popup that can be viewed by clicking on the image. I used
CSS to make the cursor turn into a hand (or whatever the browser uses to indicate a link)
when you hover over the images for the projects.

When viewed on a display under 992 pixels the featured works section collapses into a single
column with 3 rows. This allows for better viewing on smaller devices. This wa tested with
emulations in Chrome's DevTools on the Nexus 5x and the iPad. Smaller displays should also
load a variant image for each project meant to allow for better viewing and less bandwidth.
